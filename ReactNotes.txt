 React (the library) splits its core logic across two main packages:
 > The main react package
    ->  Need for React features like JSX or state
    ->  It's this package that creates this virtual DOM 
    ->  Derives the current UI state.
 > The react-dom package
    ->  To manipulate the DOM with React
    ->  It's the react-dom package that will produce the actual DOM
    ->  The  react-dom/client part of that package, acts as a "translation bridge" between your React code, the internally generated virtual DOM,
        and the browser with its actual DOM that needs to be updated.
